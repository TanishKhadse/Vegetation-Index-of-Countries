This was a hackathon project made for the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign Digital Agriculture Summer Course. 

As I learned about the intersection of agriculture and computing through the course, it seemed helpful to create a program that would help a user visualize the vegetation index for countries around the globe, as well as various Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images.

Using a pre-existing database of countries and vegetation values, we extracted these values and used them to shade in the corresponding country on a map that was created using the cartopy python package. The intensity of the shading relates to the relative value of the vegetation index for that country.

Other notes: 
This project won first prize in the hackathon.
